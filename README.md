#Number-to-Words Converter
This Python program converts various types of numbers into their respective word representations. 
It supports 
    integers, 
    floating-point numbers, 
    rational numbers (fractions),
    imaginary numbers. 
    
The program allows users to input a number, view its conversion in words, and optionally input another number for conversion.

Integer Support:
    Converts integers (both positive and negative) into words.
    Example: 12345 → "twelve thousand three hundred forty-five"

Floating-Point Number Support:
    Converts floating-point numbers into words, separating the integer and fractional parts.
    Example: 123.45 → "one hundred twenty-three point four five"

Rational Number Support:
    Converts fractions into words by processing the numerator and denominator.
    Example: 3/4 → "three over four"

Imaginary Number Support:
    Converts complex numbers (real and imaginary parts) into words.
    Example: 5 + 6i → "five plus six i"

Negative Numbers:
    Handles negative numbers across all supported types.
    Example: -456.78 → "minus four hundred fifty-six point seven eight"

Continuous Mode:
After each conversion, the program asks if the user would like to continue or exit.
    Would you like to input another number? (yes/no): no
    Exiting the program. Goodbye!
    
Error Handling
    If the user enters an invalid number, the program displays a prompt to enter a valid number.
    Handles edge cases like 0, negative numbers, and large integers.
